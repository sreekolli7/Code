									   // I put all those other sports and I thinking they should come
									   //out false because volleyball is the sport I like? Also I am not 
									   //sure on how print out so that I can became volleyball is my main sport?
		}

	// Declare favSport and make it input using scanf.. now write switch to print different outputs in diff scenarios

}
//Good job but no case for Volleyball..there is one for cae default (or something ) which you can use to print for not 3 cases
