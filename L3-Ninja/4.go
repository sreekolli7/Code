		                    // I put a if statment so I can get how many years I b
							// been alive because for example if I was alive for this amount of time
			if x> 2021      // I made it to x because I want to know how long I lived for until now
			 {       

		fmt.Println(x) 
		x--                           // I think I did x-- because I am subtracting because I want to know
		                              // how many years I been alive I think this is wrong but
									  // I am confused on if I should put ++?
	}
}

// Same like previous but use for and move condition to if. declare and increment year in for

//Solution is wrong . lets discuss it
