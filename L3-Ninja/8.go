package main

//Create a program that uses a switch statement with no switch expression specified.

func main() {
	switch { 
	//I am not sure if I did this correctly becuase in the video is was kind of
	// different? this is wrong but I am confused on why the fmtPrintln is wrong because I put semilicons
	//to make it a new statment and print out false
	case (2 > 4):
		fmtPrintln("false")

	}
	// use booleans as switch expressions

}
